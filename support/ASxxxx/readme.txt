avxv5pxx_6811_no_opt.patch:

The avxv5pxx_6811_no_opt.patch patch file was created to remove the
direct addressing mode optimization in the 6811 Assembler, as
described in the M6811 Code-Seeking Disassembler documentation.

To apply, unzip the av5p06.zip file: 

On Linux and Mac, use:
unzip -L -a av5p06.zip
From the folder you unzip to, run:
patch -p1 < avxv5pxx_6811_no_opt.patch

On Windows, use:
unzip av5p06.zip
From the folder you unzip to, run:
patch -p1 < avxv5pxx_6811_no_opt_windows.patch

This will update the AS6811 assembler to not optimize addresses
in the 0x0000-0x00FF range to Direct (S_DIR) Addressing Mode
unless they are preceded by the "*" symbol and instead keep them
as Extended (S_EXT) Addressing Mode.

This is needed to make sure that code generated by the M6811DIS
program, when reassembled with the AS6811 assembler, will produce
the same original binary that was disassembled.
